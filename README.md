# Lock-Box-Control
The increasing demand for secure and user-friendly access control solutions, particularly in the context of property management, has driven the development of various locking systems and authentication methods. Arduino, as an open-source platform, offers a flexible and accessible environment for creating embedded systems applications. The integration of web technologies with Arduino-based projects further expands the potential for innovative and practical solutions. This project aims to develop a secure and user-friendly Arduino-based lock box access control system that utilizes the Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino for rapid prototyping and deployment.
